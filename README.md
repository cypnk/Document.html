# Document.html
A Basic Set of Styles for Typical Content Documents

This is a common starting point for most of my personal documents which have a hierarchial structure and may contain footnotes. 

The content is formatted into articles, sections, and footers. Each are in their respective element types. Link footnotes can be added by making the 'href' attribute start with ```#note``` and the reference text. This is a deliberate choice to avoid using a dedicated word processor. The document is meant to be edited with any ordinary text editor, such as Notepad. Articles and sections can have custom labeling added with the ```data-label``` element attribute.

There is some basic input styling included, however this is not the main focus of the document. The editable select box can be implmented in JavaScript, which is also outside this scope.

### Document.html is feature complete 
No other changes will be made to it, except to improve compatibility with future browsers or fix any errors, as the formatting is meant for a specific personal use-case.
